# Fruit-rotten-or-not
This project is based on neural networking and it helps in detecting weather the fruit in the photo is rotten or not.


## Aim of the project

    1. To Identify which fruit is in the picture.(Classification)
    2. Also detects weather the fruit is rotton or not.
    3. Uses a webbased interface developed using flask, HTML, javascript, CSS and Bootstrap.

This project is based on deep learning / neural networking which is a sub-branch of machine learning. Deep learning is capable of unsupervised learning which means it doesnâ€™t need labled data for leaning.
Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making.  
This project will detect weather weather the fruit is rotten or not by processing the provided picture of fruit using deep learning.


Note: Kindly do not push any changes to Main or Master Branch. Create a New Branch and push all the changes to that branch.
