## About Project

First the input image will be provided to the model using the web interface then the image will be classified into its fruit type and weather it is rotten or not

This project is based on deep learning / neural networking which is a sub-branch of machine learning.
Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making.  
This project will detect weather weather the fruit is rotten or not by processing the provided picture of fruit using deep learning.


## Dataset

This dataset is divided into two sub parts :
* Training dataset
* Testing dataset

The training dataset contains a total of 1212 images and the testing data set contains a total of 300 images.



Each of these data sets are further divided into 6 more sub types :
